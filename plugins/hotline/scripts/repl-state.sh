# REPL state: reading a live claude REPL's condition off its rendered screen.

# SOURCE this, don't execute it. Two scripts need the same judgements and must
# never disagree about them:
#
#   skills/dial/scripts/cmux-reuse-surface.sh      — may I type into this REPL?
#   skills/dial/scripts/close-superseded-surface.sh — is this REPL safe to kill?
#
# The second question is strictly more dangerous than the first, and both turn on
# the same signals. Duplicating them is how one copy learns about a new spinner
# wording and the other doesn't — this repo has lost time to exactly that in the
# transcript parser, twice.
#
# Every function takes a captured screen as $1 and reads nothing itself, so the
# caller decides whether it wants the visible viewport or scrollback.

# --- Reading the REPL's state off its rendered screen -------------------------
# The claude REPL draws its input box as a `❯`-prefixed line between two
# horizontal rules at the bottom of the screen. The transcript above it echoes
# prior user turns with the SAME glyph, so more than one candidate line is
# usually on screen. Two things disambiguate, in order of reliability:
#   1. The live box pads its glyph with a NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0); the transcript
#      echoes use a plain space. Verified on claude 2.1.221.
#   2. Failing that, the box is the LAST such line — it's drawn at the bottom.
# Byte escapes rather than \u so this still works under bash 3.2 (macOS system).
REPL_BOX_GLYPH=$'\xe2\x9d\xaf'   # ❯
REPL_BOX_NBSP=$'\xc2\xa0'        # the box's padding after the glyph

# Echoes whatever text is sitting in the REPL's input box ("" when it's empty).

# True when the screen shows a turn in flight. Two independent markers, because
# neither is dependable alone: "esc to interrupt" is absent in some versions
# (including 2.1.221), and the spinner's wording changes between releases — but
# a RUNNING spinner always carries a live elapsed-time parenthetical, e.g.
# "✶ Dilly-dallying… (5s · ↓ 124 tokens · …)", whereas the finished one does not
# ("✻ Baked for 12s"). Callers add a screen-stability check on top.
