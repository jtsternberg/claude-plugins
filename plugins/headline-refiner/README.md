```

## Description

Refines headlines for articles, blog posts, email subject lines, landing pages, or social media using a structured 5-part framework: Number, What, Who, Why, and Twist the Knife.

## Usage

The skill triggers when you:
- "improve this headline"
- "write a better title"
- "make this catchier"
- Ask for headline help on any content

## The 5-Part Framework

1. **Number** — Specific quantity creates clarity
2. **What** — Clear topic identification
3. **Who** — Target audience (explicit or implied)
4. **Why** — Outcome or benefit
5. **Twist** — Stack additional outcomes for impact

## Example

**Before:** "Writing Tips"

**After:** "7 writing habits that helped me publish 300 articles in 2 years"

## How It Works

1. Analyzes current headline against the framework
2. Clarifies content and target audience
3. Generates 3-5 refined variations
4. Validates and recommends the strongest option
