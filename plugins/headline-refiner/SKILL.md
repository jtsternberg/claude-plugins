# Headline Refiner

Transform weak headlines into compelling ones using the 5-Part Headline Framework.

## Quick Example

**Before:** "Writing Tips"
**After:** "7 writing habits that helped me publish 300 articles in 2 years"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze the Current Headline

Identify which of the 5 components are present or missing:
- **Number** — How many things promised?
- **What** — Is the topic clear?
- **Who** — Is the audience explicit or implied?
- **Why** — Is there a positive or negative outcome?
- **Twist** — Are additional outcomes stacked?

For detailed guidance on each component, see `references/framework-guide.md`.

### Step 2: Clarify the Content

Before refining, understand:
- What exactly is the reader getting?
- Who is the ideal reader?
- What outcome do they want? What do they want to avoid?

### Step 3: Generate Refined Options

Produce 3-5 headline variations. Include at least:
- One with explicit audience naming
- One with positive outcome framing
- One with negative outcome framing
- One that "twists the knife" with stacked outcomes

### Step 4: Validate and Recommend

Verify each option against the checklist in `references/framework-guide.md`. Select the strongest based on:
- Clarity (if confused, reader is gone)
- Specificity (concrete > vague)
- Relevance to target audience
- Platform constraints (if applicable)

## Platform Constraints

When space is limited, prioritize in this order:
1. **What** (always required—clarity is non-negotiable)
2. **Number** (helps set expectations)
3. **Who** (if building an audience, name them)
4. **Why** (positive or negative outcome)
5. **Twist** (only if space allows)
