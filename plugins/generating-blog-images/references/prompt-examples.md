# Prompt Examples

Concrete examples showing input blog content and resulting image prompts.

## Example 1: Personal Essay (The Performance Treadmill)

**Blog excerpt**: A reflective piece about approval addiction, using metaphors of a treadmill, a hamster wheel, and "the stick" (the idea that strengths and weaknesses are two ends of the same stick).

### Hero Image

**Purpose**: Capture the central metaphor of endless striving for approval

**Prompt**: Editorial illustration of a solitary figure running on a treadmill that extends infinitely into fog, muted blue-gray palette with warm amber highlights on the figure, side profile view, atmospheric and contemplative mood, subtle motion blur on the legs, negative space above, painterly digital art style, 16:9 aspect ratio

**Style notes**: Avoid showing the figure's face (keeps it universal). No sweat or gym setting—this is metaphorical, not literal fitness.

### Section Break: "The Stick"

**Purpose**: Visualize the concept that strengths and weaknesses are connected

**Prompt**: Minimalist illustration of a single wooden stick or branch held horizontally, one end glowing with warm golden light, the other end casting a shadow, clean white background, centered composition, subtle wood grain texture, soft gradient lighting, editorial magazine style, 4:3 aspect ratio

**Style notes**: Keep extremely simple. The stick itself is the focus—no hands holding it, no other elements.

---

### Emotional Beat: "The Scramble"

**Purpose**: Show the frantic energy of trying to earn approval

**Prompt**: Abstract expressionist image of multiple overlapping hands reaching upward toward a single point of light that remains just out of reach, desaturated cool tones with one warm highlight, dynamic diagonal composition, sense of motion and urgency, textured brushstroke effect, square format

**Style notes**: Avoid literal depictions of people pleasing. This should feel desperate but artistic, not literal.

## Example 2: Technical Tutorial (API Integration Guide)

**Blog excerpt**: A step-by-step guide to integrating a payment API, covering authentication, webhooks, and error handling.

### Hero Image

**Purpose**: Establish the technical but approachable tone

**Prompt**: Isometric illustration of interlocking geometric blocks representing API connections, one block labeled-style element connecting to multiple smaller blocks, flat design with subtle shadows, blue and purple gradient palette with white accents, clean lines, professional tech aesthetic, 16:9 aspect ratio

**Style notes**: No literal code or screens. Avoid the "floating holographic UI" cliché.

---

### Concept Illustration: Webhook Flow

**Purpose**: Visualize the request/response cycle

**Prompt**: Clean technical diagram showing three connected nodes with directional arrows forming a cycle, minimal flat design, monochromatic blue with accent color for the arrows, generous whitespace, infographic style, no text labels, 4:3 aspect ratio

**Style notes**: This will have text added separately—keep the diagram simple and label-free.

---

## Example 3: Opinion Piece (Remote Work Culture)

**Blog excerpt**: An argument that remote work has fundamentally changed expectations around availability and work-life boundaries.

### Hero Image

**Purpose**: Capture the tension between work and personal life in remote settings

**Prompt**: Split composition photograph style image, left side showing a laptop on a kitchen table with morning light, right side showing the same table set for dinner with candles, seamless blend in the middle, warm natural lighting throughout, shallow depth of field, contemplative domestic mood, 16:9 aspect ratio

**Style notes**: Avoid showing people or screens with content. The emptiness of the spaces tells the story.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Don't do this**:
- "A person looking stressed at a computer" — too literal, stock photo feeling
- "A lightbulb representing ideas" — overused cliché
- "Hands shaking to represent partnership" — corporate stock imagery
- "A maze representing complexity" — overdone metaphor
- "Image with the text 'Performance Treadmill' on it" — AI can't render text well

**Do this instead**:
- Use the post's specific metaphors (the treadmill, the stick, the scramble)
- Create atmospheric, editorial-quality imagery
- Leave space for the reader's interpretation
- Specify what to exclude, not just what to include
